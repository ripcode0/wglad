### üì¶ Installation

#### Option 1: Clone and Build Example
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ripcode0/wglad.git
    cd wglad
    cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_EXAMPLE=ON
    cmake --build build
    ```
2. Include `wglad` source files in your project.
3. Ensure you have the necessary `GLAD` files generated from the [GLAD Generator](https://gen.glad.sh/).

#### Option 2: Add as a Submodule
1. Add `wglad` as a submodule to your repository:
    ```bash
    git submodule add https://github.com/ripcode0/wglad.git <submodule-path>/wglad
    ```
2. Update your build system to include WGLAD.

#### Option 3: Add Subdirectory
1. Clone or Submodule
2. Link the library to your project:
    - For CMake:
      ```cmake
      add_subdirectory(wglad)
      
      target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE wglad)
      or
      target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE wglad::wglad)
      ```
    - For manual linking, add the `.lib` or `.a` file to your linker options.

### üìñ Usage

1. Include `wglad` in your project:
    ```cpp
    #include "<wglad/wglad.h>
    ```

2. Initialize `wglad` in your OpenGL application:
    ```cpp
    HDC dc{};
    HGLRC rc{};

    wglad::create_context_from_hwnd(hwnd, &rc, &dc, true);
    ```

3. Render process:
    ```cpp
    glClearColor(0.2f, 0.25f, 0.3f, 1.f);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

    //render contents

    ::SwapBuffers(dc);
    ```
4. Discard `wglad` context:
    ```cpp
    wglad::release_context(hwnd, &rc, &dc);
    ```
