    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WGLAD.git
    cd WGLAD
    ```
2. Include WGLAD source files in your project.
3. Ensure you have the necessary GLAD files generated from the [GLAD Generator](https://gen.glad.sh/).

### Option 2: Add as a Submodule
1. Add WGLAD as a submodule to your repository:
    ```bash
    git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/WGLAD.git
    ```
2. Update your build system to include WGLAD.

### Option 3: Precompiled Library
1. Download the precompiled WGLAD library from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/WGLAD/releases).
2. Link the library to your project:
    - For CMake:
      ```cmake
      target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE WGLAD)
      ```
    - For manual linking, add the `.lib` or `.a` file to your linker options.

## üìñ Usage

1. Include WGLAD in your project:
    ```cpp
    #include "wglad.h"
    ```

2. Initialize WGLAD in your OpenGL application:
    ```cpp
    if (!wglad::initialize()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to initialize WGLAD!" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    ```

3. Start writing OpenGL code without worrying about the loading process:
    ```cpp
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
    ```
